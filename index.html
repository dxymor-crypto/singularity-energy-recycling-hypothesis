  <h1>Singularity Energy Recycling Hypothesis</h1>
  <p><strong>Proposed by COLA</strong> — 2025.</p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Singularity Energy Recycling Hypothesis</strong> suggests that black holes are not merely gravitational sinks, 
    but rather act as <em>cosmic energy recovery mechanisms</em> within the broader universal cycle.  
    According to this model, when matter and energy are absorbed by black holes, they are not destroyed — instead, they transition into fundamental states beyond the observable boundary of spacetime.
  </p>

  <p>
    These energy states may accumulate “beyond the singularity” — in a non-observable domain or thin membrane of energy continuity.  
    Over vast cosmological timescales, this stored energy could contribute to the re-initiation of universal expansion — 
    suggesting that black holes may prepare the foundation for the next cosmological cycle, a re-birth from a singularity event.
  </p>

  <p>
    This concept connects black hole dynamics, singularity theory, and cyclic cosmology in a speculative but unified framework of energy transformation — 
    viewing the universe not as a one-time explosion, but as an iterative energy system that continuously collapses and reforms itself.
